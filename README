See directory 'example' for a example of expected use patterns.
It contains a shell script 'rebuild-all.sh' which can run from terminal or Mac GUI.
(Platforms other than Mac, you should delete the last line of that script).
On a successful run, it creates 'output' directories in each of the subdirectories, containing the card images.

Each subdirectory contains card data in 'cards.tsv' and the master script in 'script'.
'tsv' files contain rows separated by newline (LF) and columns separated by tab (HT).
The first row are captions, each subsequent non-empty row is a card.

Where a script refers to files, the path may be absolute (beginning with slash) or relative to the script's directory.
When referring to a font, you may also use short names and we search likely places.
eg you can ask for "Arial" instead of "/Library/Fonts/Arial.ttf".

The canonical documentation for script syntax is in the source: src/data/imgtl_script.h
